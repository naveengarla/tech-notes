# Welcome to My Tech Notes

After more than two decades in software engineering — moving from developer to enterprise architect — I've accumulated countless notes, diagrams, principles, mistakes, and hard-earned lessons.

For years, they lived in private documents and whiteboard photos.

This blog is where I'm finally organizing them in public.

## Why I'm Starting This Now

Recently, I noticed something about myself.

Whenever I try to explain a system — whether it's a cloud architecture, an API gateway strategy, or a GenAI integration — I don't think in buzzwords. I think in fundamentals:

- What problem are we really solving?
- What breaks if this scales?
- Who owns what?
- How does this decision affect the business six months from now?

Writing forces that thinking to become sharper.  
And if it becomes sharper for me, it may help someone else too.

So this blog is my structured thinking space — shared openly.

## What You'll Find Here

This space will reflect the work I'm deeply involved in:

### Enterprise Architecture in Practice
Designing API-first platforms, DevSecOps governance, scaling multi-team systems, and building reference architectures that survive real enterprise constraints.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
AKS, API Management, identity systems, GitHub Enterprise pipelines, observability patterns, and the trade-offs behind cloud-native decisions.

### GenAI & Platform Engineering
Building internal GenAI platforms, LLM integration patterns, agentic workflows, prompt management, and moving AI experiments into production safely.

### Systems Thinking & Leadership
How technical decisions shape organizations, how governance protects business stability, and how architects grow into strategic roles.

## Built Simply

This blog runs on:

- **MkDocs (Material theme)**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **GitHub Actions**
- Plain Markdown

Simple tools. Clear structure. No unnecessary complexity.

## What's Next

The next few posts will dive into topics I'm currently working on — including how to design scalable API platforms without slowing teams down, and what it really means to build a GenAI system inside an enterprise.

If you're building, architecting, or leading technical systems — I hope you'll find something useful here.
